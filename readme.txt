Abalon is an ancient Spanish game played by two.
The aim is to push six stones of the opponent out of
the hexagon. Maximum three stones can be moved at
once in a row by one step, and more stones of one 
player can  always push less of the other (i.e. 2-1,
3-1 or 3-2).

The game contains five algorithms that can be played
by the computer if you chose the name _0,_1,_2,_3
or _4 for one of the players of for both.
Clicking on the time-box toggles the time indication.
Clicking on the little red lamp suspends and resumes
the game.
